Aim:
To demonstrate the use of friend functions across two classes.
Algorithm:
1.	Create classes Account and Loan.
2.	Declare a friend function checkEligibility() in both classes.
3.	Input balance and loan amount.
4.	Use the friend function to check eligibility and display result.
Program:
#include <iostream> using namespace std;
class Loan; class Account {
float balance;
public:
void getBalance() {
cout << "Enter account balance: "; cin >> balance;
}
friend void checkEligibility(Account, Loan);
};
class Loan {
float loanAmount; public:
void getLoan() {
cout << "Enter loan amount: "; cin >> loanAmount;
}
friend void checkEligibility(Account, Loan);
};
void checkEligibility(Account a, Loan l) { if (a.balance >= 2 * l.loanAmount)
cout << " Eligible for loan" << endl;
else
}
cout << " Not eligible for loan" << endl;
int main() {
Account acc;
Loan ln;

acc.getBalance(); ln.getLoan(); checkEligibility(acc, ln); return 0;
}
Output:
Enter account balance: 50000 Enter loan amount: 20000
 Eligible for loan
