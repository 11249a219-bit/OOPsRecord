Aim:
To demonstrate constructor/destructor order in inheritance.
Algorithm:
1.	Define Book base and LibraryBook derived class.
2.	Add constructors and destructors printing messages.
Program:
#include <iostream> using namespace std;
class Book { public:
Book() { cout << "Base class Book constructor\n"; }
~Book() { cout << "Base class Book destructor\n"; }
};
class LibraryBook : public Book { public:
LibraryBook() { cout << "Derived class LibraryBook constructor\n"; }
~LibraryBook() { cout << "Derived class LibraryBook destructor\n"; }
};
int main() {
LibraryBook lb;
}
Output:
Base class Book constructor
Derived class LibraryBook constructor Derived class LibraryBook destructor Base class Book destructor
